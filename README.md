## KISS: Keep It Simple Stupide

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20b3a77a-a313-454b-9b8c-9347f621df10)

As a game, it is just an app where you can play some remote control toys found on the web and on Amazon.
As an application, it is remote control interface for Iot and to play game on Window.
As a workshop, it is an application to learn code and networking.
As a multiplayer, it is gate to play on a single massive multiplayer game from integers.

As you can see it is not simple ^^, that a laboratory.
All code in the app is fetchable on the GitHub.


May the code be without.

Kind regards,
Eloi
